**US Authorities Shatter Massive Crypto Scam, Seize Record $15 Billion in Bitcoin from Cambodian Executive**

In a landmark victory against global cybercrime, U.S. authorities have unveiled charges against Cambodian executive Chen Zhi, the alleged mastermind behind a sprawling cryptocurrency "pig butchering" scam, and announced the unprecedented seizure of approximately $15 billion in Bitcoin. This monumental action marks the largest cryptocurrency forfeiture in the history of the U.S. Department of Justice and underscores a growing international effort to dismantle sophisticated online fraud networks often linked to forced labor.

Chen Zhi, chairman of the multinational conglomerate Prince Holding Group based in Cambodia, was indicted on charges including wire fraud conspiracy. Prosecutors allege that Zhi and his co-conspirators operated a vast criminal enterprise that exploited forced labor in scam compounds across Cambodia. Victims, primarily from the U.S. and other parts of the world, were ensnared in elaborate "pig butchering" schemes. These deceptive investment frauds, known for their slow, meticulous grooming of victims before draining their assets, typically involve scammers building trust and romantic relationships with targets, then convincing them to invest in fraudulent cryptocurrency platforms.

The indictment details how individuals, many trafficked under false pretenses, were forced to work in these scam centers, coerced into perpetrating the fraud against unsuspecting victims. The proceeds from these illicit operations, amounting to billions of dollars, were allegedly laundered and used to fund luxurious lifestyles for the perpetrators, including the acquisition of yachts and private jets.

The staggering $15 billion Bitcoin seizure highlights the immense scale of the fraud and the increasing capability of law enforcement agencies to trace and recover digital assets used in criminal activities. This operation is not an isolated incident but part of a broader crackdown on burgeoning scam hubs in Southeast Asia, where criminal organizations have leveraged lax regulations and vulnerable populations to establish large-scale fraud operations.

The U.S. and the UK have been actively targeting individuals and entities involved in these networks. Last year, both nations imposed sanctions on another prominent Cambodian tycoon, Ly Yong Phat, citing his alleged involvement in forced labor, human trafficking, and online scams. These coordinated international efforts signal a heightened commitment to combating these complex, transnational criminal enterprises that exploit both victims of financial fraud and victims of forced labor.

The charging of Chen Zhi and the record-breaking Bitcoin seizure send a strong message to cybercriminals globally: the digital veil of anonymity is increasingly permeable, and law enforcement agencies are developing sophisticated methods to track, prosecute, and recover assets from those who engage in cryptocurrency-related fraud and human exploitation. This operation serves as a critical step in disrupting a significant facet of the global cybercrime landscape and offers a stark reminder of the risks associated with unverified online investments and the insidious nature of "pig butchering" scams.
