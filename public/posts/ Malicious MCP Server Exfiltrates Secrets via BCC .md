## Novel Exfiltration Vector: Hijacking BCCâ€™s MCP for MicroVM Secret Disclosure

A sophisticated secret exfiltration vector has emerged, leveraging the `bcc` (BPF Compiler Collection) toolkit's MicroVM Credentials Proxy (MCP) mechanism to compromise sensitive data within constrained environments like Firecracker MicroVMs. This attack highlights the critical importance of scrutinizing internal tooling configurations and network egress policies, even for seemingly innocuous environment variables.

### The BCC MCP Mechanism: An Overview

`bcc` is a powerful framework for creating efficient kernel tracing and manipulation programs using eBPF. In cloud and containerized environments, `bcc` tools often require access to instance metadata or dynamic credentials, such as AWS IAM roles or Kubernetes service account tokens. However, in highly isolated MicroVM architectures like AWS Firecracker, direct access to the standard EC2 Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) at `169.254.169.254` is frequently restricted for enhanced security.

To bridge this gap, `bcc` implements a MicroVM Credentials Proxy (MCP) mechanism. This typically involves a proxy server running *within* the MicroVM's network, which then securely fetches credentials from the host system or an external service and provides them to the `bcc` tools. The address of this MCP server is configured via the `BCC_MCP_ADDR` environment variable, defaulting to `169.254.169.254:8000` in many Firecracker-based setups. When `bcc` tools require credentials, they consult this variable to determine where to send their requests.

### The Malicious MCP Server Attack Vector

The newly identified attack vector exploits this legitimate `BCC_MCP_ADDR` configuration. An attacker, having achieved initial code execution within a container or process inside a MicroVM, can modify this environment variable to point to an arbitrary, attacker-controlled external server.

Once `BCC_MCP_ADDR` is successfully hijacked, any subsequent execution of `bcc` tools that attempt to retrieve credentials or instance metadata will unwittingly direct those sensitive queries to the malicious server. The attacker's server, posing as the legitimate MCP, then receives these requests, typically via HTTP POST, thereby capturing valuable secrets.

### Scope of Exfiltrated Secrets

The sensitive information at risk through this method is substantial and includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Cloud Provider Credentials:** AWS Access Key IDs, Secret Access Keys, and Session Tokens.
*   **Kubernetes Secrets:** API server addresses (`KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST`, `KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_ADDR`), port numbers, and potentially service account tokens if `bcc` is configured to fetch them.
*   **Environment Variables:** Any other environment variables or instance metadata fields that `bcc` tools are programmed or configured to retrieve from the MCP.

This attack vector is particularly insidious because it leverages an internal, seemingly benign configuration designed for operational utility. The exfiltration occurs via standard HTTP requests, which may blend into legitimate network traffic if egress filtering is not sufficiently granular.

### Mitigation Strategies and Hardening

Defending against this novel exfiltration technique requires a multi-layered approach focusing on network segmentation, least privilege, and runtime monitoring:

1.  **Strict Egress Filtering:** Implement robust network policies that severely restrict outbound network connections from MicroVMs and containers. Only permit connections to known, whitelisted endpoints and ports essential for application function. Block all egress to unknown IP ranges or the internet. This is the most critical preventative measure.
2.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that containers and workloads within MicroVMs operate with the absolute minimum necessary permissions. This includes limiting their ability to modify environment variables or execute arbitrary commands.
3.  **Runtime Monitoring and Anomaly Detection:** Deploy security tools that monitor network connections originating from containers and `bcc` processes. Look for anomalous connections to external IP addresses, unusual data volumes, or uncharacteristic POST requests.
4.  **Static Analysis and Configuration Hardening:** Incorporate static code analysis and security configuration checks into CI/CD pipelines to identify instances where `bcc` tools are deployed and assess their potential for `BCC_MCP_ADDR` manipulation. Consider overriding or nullifying `BCC_MCP_ADDR` if `bcc` tools are not intended to fetch credentials via this mechanism.
5.  **Supply Chain Security for BCC:** Vet `bcc` tool versions and their dependencies for known vulnerabilities or unexpected behaviors that could contribute to this attack. Ensure `bcc` is only installed and executed when strictly necessary.

### Conclusion

The malicious MCP server attack via `BCC_MCP_ADDR` presents a compelling reminder that security risks extend beyond common attack surfaces. Internal mechanisms, designed for legitimate operational purposes, can become potent exfiltration vectors when combined with a compromised workload and lax network controls. Organizations leveraging MicroVMs and `bcc` tooling must meticulously review their security postures, particularly around network egress and environmental variable integrity, to safeguard against this insidious form of secret disclosure.
