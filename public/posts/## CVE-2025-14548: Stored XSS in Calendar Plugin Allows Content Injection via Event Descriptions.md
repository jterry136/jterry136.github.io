## CVE-2025-14548: Stored XSS in Calendar Plugin Allows Content Injection via Event Descriptions

**Introduction**

A significant security vulnerability, designated as CVE-2025-14548, has been discovered in the "Calendar" plugin for WordPress, affecting versions up to and including 1.3.16. This vulnerability is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw that can be triggered by authenticated users with at least Contributor-level privileges. The flaw lies in the improper sanitization of the 'event_desc' field, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that are then stored on the website and executed whenever a user views the affected event. This can lead to various security risks, including session hijacking, credential theft, and unauthorized actions.

**The Vulnerability: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**

Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security exploit where malicious scripts are permanently stored on the targeted application, such as in a database, forum post, comment field, or, as in this case, an event description. Unlike reflected XSS, where the script is delivered via a malicious link and executed immediately upon clicking, stored XSS attacks are delivered indirectly. The malicious script resides on the server and is served to multiple users when they access the vulnerable content.

In CVE-2025-14548, the "Calendar" plugin fails to properly sanitize or escape user-supplied input in the 'event_desc' (event description) field. When a user with sufficient privileges (Contributor or higher) creates or edits an event, they can insert JavaScript code within the description. The plugin then stores this description, including the embedded script, in the website's database without adequate filtering. Subsequently, whenever any user views this event (whether they are authenticated or not), their browser will interpret and execute the stored JavaScript, leading to the XSS attack.

**Exploitation Scenario**

The exploitation of CVE-2025-14548 typically involves the following steps:

1.  **Gaining Access:** An attacker must first obtain authenticated access to the WordPress website with at least Contributor-level privileges. This could be achieved through various means, such as using stolen credentials, exploiting other vulnerabilities, or being granted such access legitimately for content contribution.
2.  **Injecting Malicious Script:** The attacker then uses the "Calendar" plugin to create a new event or edit an existing one. Within the 'event_desc' field, they embed malicious JavaScript code. For example, they might inject a script designed to steal session cookies or redirect users to a phishing page.
3.  **Storing the Payload:** The attacker submits the event with the malicious description. The "Calendar" plugin stores this description, including the embedded script, in the website's database.
4.  **Script Execution:** When any user, including administrators, visitors, or other authenticated users, accesses the calendar and views the event containing the malicious description, their browser automatically executes the embedded JavaScript. This leads to the XSS attack payload being triggered in the context of the user's browser session on the trusted website.

**Impact of the Vulnerability**

The successful exploitation of CVE-2025-14548 can have severe consequences:

*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal the session cookies of authenticated users, including administrators, allowing them to impersonate those users and gain unauthorized access to the website.
*   **Credential Theft:** Malicious scripts can be used to create fake login forms or capture user input, leading to the theft of usernames and passwords.
*   **Website Defacement:** Attackers can modify the appearance of the website or inject unwanted content by manipulating the DOM.
*   **Phishing Attacks:** Redirecting users to malicious websites designed to steal sensitive information.
*   **Malware Distribution:** The injected scripts could be used to prompt users to download malware.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** An attacker who hijacks an administrator's session can perform any action on the website, including creating new malicious content, deleting data, or changing critical settings.

**Mitigation and Recommendations**

To defend against CVE-2025-14548, users of the "Calendar" plugin should take immediate action:

1.  **Update the Plugin:** The most critical step is to update the "Calendar" plugin to version 1.3.17 or later. This update should include proper input sanitization and escaping for the 'event_desc' field, effectively neutralizing the XSS vulnerability.
2.  **Input Sanitization and Escaping:** If updating is not immediately feasible, review the plugin's code for input sanitization and output escaping functions related to the 'event_desc' field. Implementing these checks can help prevent script execution. However, updating is the recommended and most secure approach.
3.  **Security Plugins:** Employ reputable WordPress security plugins that offer XSS detection and prevention capabilities. These plugins can often identify and block malicious scripts in user-generated content.
4.  **Limit User Privileges:** Adhere to the principle of least privilege. Ensure that users only have the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Restrict the ability to create or edit events to trusted users with roles that strictly require it.
5.  **Content Filtering:** If possible, configure content filters or use security measures that scan and sanitize user-submitted content before it is displayed.

**Conclusion**

CVE-2025-14548 highlights the persistent threat of Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities, particularly within user-generated content fields. The failure to adequately sanitize the 'event_desc' field in the "Calendar" plugin allowed for persistent script injection, posing a significant risk to website security and user data. By updating the plugin to the patched version and implementing robust security practices, website administrators can effectively mitigate this vulnerability and protect their sites from malicious script execution and its damaging consequences.
