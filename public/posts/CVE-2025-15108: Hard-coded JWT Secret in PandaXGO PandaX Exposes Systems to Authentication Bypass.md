CVE-2025-15108: Hard-coded JWT Secret in PandaXGO PandaX Exposes Systems to Authentication Bypass

A critical vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-15108, has been discovered in PandaXGO's PandaX, stemming from a hard-coded JWT secret within its `config.yml` file. This flaw could potentially allow attackers to forge legitimate authentication tokens, leading to unauthorized access and system compromise.

**Understanding the Vulnerability**

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a standard for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. They are often used for authentication and authorization in web applications. A JWT is typically signed using a secret key. If this secret key is hard-coded and accessible to unauthorized individuals, an attacker can use it to sign their own malicious JWTs, which the application would then trust as authentic.

In the case of CVE-2025-15108, the PandaX application, a component of PandaXGO, has its JWT secret value stored directly in the `config.yml` file. This makes the secret easily discoverable if an attacker gains even limited access to the application's configuration files. With this secret, an attacker can:

*   **Forge JWTs:** Create custom JWTs that appear to be issued by the PandaX application.
*   **Bypass Authentication:** Use these forged JWTs to log in as any user, including administrative accounts, without valid credentials.
*   **Gain Unauthorized Access:** Access sensitive data, modify system configurations, or execute malicious code within the compromised system.

**Impact and Mitigation**

The impact of this vulnerability can range from data breaches to complete system takeover, depending on the privileges associated with the compromised accounts. Organizations using PandaXGO's PandaX are strongly advised to:

1.  **Update Immediately:** Apply any patches or updates provided by PandaXGO to address this vulnerability.
2.  **Rotate Secrets:** If an update is not immediately available, manually change the JWT secret. Ensure the new secret is a strong, randomly generated string and is not hard-coded in configuration files. Instead, consider using environment variables or a secrets management system.
3.  **Review Access Logs:** Scrutinize access logs for any suspicious activity that might indicate a prior compromise.
4.  **Secure Configuration Files:** Implement strict access controls for all configuration files to prevent unauthorized viewing or modification.

This vulnerability highlights the critical importance of secure coding practices, particularly regarding the management of secrets and sensitive credentials within applications. Developers must avoid hard-coding sensitive information and instead rely on robust secrets management solutions.
